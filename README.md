#### Update Oct 13, 2022:
Rather than sending external link to well known player stat websites, I am working on using APIs to gather data and send it as an embedded message on Discord. I'm currently working on [Riot API](https://developer.riotgames.com/) using [RiotWatcher](https://riot-watcher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and will be using it for other Riot games (TFT, Val, LoR). Once that's knocked out, I'll work on other games.

Also, [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is getting rid of their free Dynos that was letting me host StatBot for free so I'm gonna have to pull StatBot out until I feel that it's polished and I'll find another site to host it.
